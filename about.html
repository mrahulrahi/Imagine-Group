        <div class="mission-info">
            <p>There's this notion that to grow a business, you have to be ruthless. But we know there's a better way to
            grow. One where what's good for the bottom line is also good for customers. We believe businesses can grow
            with a conscience, and succeed with a soul — and that they can do it with inbound. That's why we've created
            an ecosystem uniting software, education, and community to help businesses grow better every day.</p>

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <div class="story-info">
          <p>As fellow graduate students at MIT in 2004, Brian and Dharmesh noticed a shift in the way people shop and
            buy. Consumers were no longer tolerating interruptive bids for their attention — in fact, they'd gotten
            really, really good at ignoring them.

            From this shift, a company was born: HubSpot. It was founded on "inbound", the notion that people don't want
            to be interrupted by marketers or harassed by salespeople — they want to be helped.

            Today, the inbound movement continues to empower businesses around the world to stop interrupting, start
            helping, and return their focus to the customer.</p>
